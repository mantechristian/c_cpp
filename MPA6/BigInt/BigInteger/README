                       BIG INTEGER LIBRARY in C++
    
    A dynamic C++ library to operate on really big integers; both signed & unsigned,
with all the basic integer operations (as one can do with standard C/C++ primitive 
integer data types like "int"/"long"/"long long") provided.

 [N.B: Type in the line "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./Test:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" in your
        terminal before running the executable "test"]
